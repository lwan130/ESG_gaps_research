	abstract = {The categorization of alternative demand patterns facilitates the selection of a forecasting method and it is an essential element of many inventory control software packages. The common practice in the inventory control software industry is to arbitrarily categorize those demand patterns and then proceed to select an estimation procedure and optimize the forecast parameters. Alternatively, forecasting methods can be directly compared, based on some theoretically quantified error measure, for the purpose of establishing regions of superior performance and then define the demand patterns based on the results. It is this approach that is discussed in this paper and its application is demonstrated by considering EWMA, Croston's method and an alternative to Croston's estimator developed by the first two authors of this paper. Comparison results are based on a theoretical analysis of the mean square error due to its mathematically tractable nature. The categorization rules proposed are expressed in terms of the average inter-demand interval and the squared coefficient of variation of demand sizes. The validity of the results is tested on 3000 real-intermittent demand data series coming from the automotive industry.},

	abstract = {Choosing a stock-control method for a product depends on that product's demand distribution. This paper presents a simple method of classifying product demand into ‘smooth’, ‘slow-moving’ or ‘sporadic’, by partitioning the variance of demand during a lead time into causal parts. A study of a public utility showed demand distributions in each category to be of a specific nature. Stock-control and forecasting methods are developed, and simulation tests are described which compare these methods with (for ease of comparison) the assumption of continuous demand.},
