<span class="header-section-number">1</span> Background</h1>
<p>This document builds upon research first presented in the discussion paper
<em>Options for Improving Use of ESG for Sovereign Bond Analysis</em> (World Bank, 2018).</p>
<p>Interviews with ESG data providers found that most obtain at least some and often a substantial amount
of data from World Bank databases.
137 indicators were specifically identified from these interviews, of which 127 could be mapped to
active databases in the World Bank’s data API, enabling the authors to <a href="#TODO">perform a rapid
assessment</a> of data coverage and gaps.
The paper further found that “data coverage is a significant issue in WBG data used for ESG.”
Looking at most recent available values (MRVs) by indicator and country, the paper found that
just 41 ESG indicators (out of 127) had a value from 2017 or later (1 year old) for at least 50% of countries;
74 ESG indicators had a value from 2015 or later (3 years old) for at least 50% of countries. However,
while the 2018 paper suggested a set of options for improving the availability and usefulness of
ESG data, it stopped short of further investigating the reasons that might give rise to gaps in data coverage
or suggesting specific strategies to address them.</p>
<p>The objective of this report is to pick up where the previous paper left off, and to better understand
the circumstances that explain gaps in data coverage. To do so, this report identifies a set of “explanations”
that could be partially responsible for gaps in any particular series. The hope is that with a better understanding
of why gaps occur and the pervasiveness of various explanatory factors, effective steps can be established to
eliminate or mitigate gaps.</p>
<p>This report uses a different selection of ESG indicators than that used in the 2018 report: 134 indicators
compared to the original 137, but not excluding indicators in inactive databases as this is an important consideration
in the gaps analysis.
The sample of indicators has expanded to include additions from two new products: the
forthcoming Blackrock Sovereign Sustainability Index (BSSI) and the World Bank’s own <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/environment-social-and-governance-data">curated ESG dataset</a>.
In addition, further research into the original group of data providers has produced additional indicators.
Conversely, we decided to remove some indicators used exclusively by one data provider (Versk-Maplecroft) because strong
similarities among those indicators (e.g., very similar trade or debt measures) may have been skewing the results.</p>
<p>The other factor that has changed since the 2018 report is of course that it is now over a year later, and some underlying
databases have been updated (at least once) with new data, while others have not been updated. As a result, if the same
analysis were performed today with 2019 as a reference the results would likely be different than those above. That said,
this document attempts to provide a more comprehensive and current understanding of data availability and coverage as context
for the gaps analysis.</p>
<p>Table <a href="background.html#tab:summ">1.1</a> provides a summary of the 134 indicators analyzed in this report,
disaggregated by pillar and origin. 44 indicators are environmental
indicators, 66 are social indicators, and 24 are governance indicators. The
World Bank is the primary source of 36 indicators, whereas the UN system is
primary source of 66 indicators, and other organizations are the source for 32
indicators.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What is a “Data Gap”</h2>
<p>It is first necessary to define what is meant by a “data gap” as several phenomena could be construed
as being a “gap.” For instance, data could be unavailable for a number of relevant economies, or there
could be gaps in the time series over a relevant time period. There could also be gaps in metadata and other
documentation. While all of these are potentially relevant, the most important gaps in the context of ESG
likely involve the most recently available values compared to the current time period, since ESG
analysis concerns investment decisions being made today and in the near future. Accordingly, this paper
defines a “data gap” as a significant difference between the current calendar year and the most recent available value(s)
(MRVs) for the indicators and economies under study. Gaps in metadata or in time periods before the MRV
are not a primary focus of this analysis.</p>

<div id="how-this-paper-is-structured" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> How This Paper is Structured</h2>
<p>This paper applies three separate approaches to better understand coverage gaps in ESG indicators:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Coverage Analysis.</strong> This approach provides a more detailed and visual picture of temporal gaps in the
ESG indicator set, both historically and by MRV.</li>
<li>
<strong>Explanation Framework Analysis.</strong> This approach sets out a set of reasons why data gaps might occur
as a framework for classifying ESG indicators, and looking at what approaches might be used to mitigate
coverage issues.</li>
<li>
<strong>Variance Analysis.</strong> This approach looks at the temporal variance of ESG indicators to better
understand the impacts of missing data for analysis. It may be possible to impute missing observations
for indicators with low variance, mitigating the impact of data gaps.</li>
</ol>
<p>The paper then concludes with a discussion section and set of recommendations based on the analysis and findings
of each of these sections.</p>
